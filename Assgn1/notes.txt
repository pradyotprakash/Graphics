To do
-----
Store the new vertices in a vector and remove the last element conveniently

If #elements % 3 != 0, then opengl would not complete the triangle so no issues (clarify if we need to draw a ln if only two points are added)

Arrange the triangle vertices in a nice fashion in an array when I is pressed

When M is pressed, create a temporary vector and push elements to it. Before doing that, rotate the view system to the original layout

When K is pressed, need to store the design in a .raw file. Can be done easily, not an issue

When L is pressed, need to open a window to select a .raw file. Show appropriate error message if there is a format mismatch or the data does not conform to specification. At this point store everything in a temporary array until everything is read from the file, so as to not disrupt what is present on the screen, in case some exception is raised.
If successful, get rid of the temporary array and use a permanent one instead.
